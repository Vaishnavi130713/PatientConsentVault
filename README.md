# PatientConsent Vault

## Project Title
PatientConsent Vault

## Project Description
PatientConsent Vault is a blockchain-based platform to securely store and verify patient signed medical consent forms. Built on Soroban smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain, it ensures immutable recording of consent documents alongside encrypted digital signatures enabling verifiable proof of patient permissions and regulatory compliance.

## Project Vision
The project aims to increase trust and patient control over consent processes by creating a transparent, tamper-proof evidence repository. It protects healthcare providers and patients through cryptographically secured consent records that can be independently verified anytime on the blockchain.

## Key Features
- Consent Registration: Store cryptographic hashes of consent documents with patient signatures.
- Signature Verification: On-chain verification of patient digital signatures for authenticity.
- Immutable Records: Permanent consent documentation stored on blockchain ledger.
- Timestamped Entries: Every consent has an immutable date-time of signing.
- Patient Control: Patients uniquely identified by blockchain addresses.
- Transparent Access: Any approved party can verify consent status publicly.
- Error Handling: Prevents duplicate records and unauthorized operations.

## Usage Instructions
1. Register Consent: Upload consent document hash and patient signature.
2. Verify Consent: Execute signature authenticity checks on-chain.
3. Query Consent: Access consent details and verification status anytime.

## Future Scope
- Multi-party Consents: Support co-signature from multiple caregivers or family members.
- Consent Revocation: Enable patients to revoke or update consents securely.
- Integration with EHR Systems: Connect consent records with electronic health records.
- Privacy Enhancements: Implement zero-knowledge proofs for confidential consents.
- Mobile Interfaces: Patient-friendly apps for managing consents.
- Legal Framework Compliance: Embed jurisdictional consent laws and audit trails.
- Cross-chain Support: Enable consent verification across different blockchain platforms.

## Technology Stack
- Soroban Rust SDK for reliable and secure smart contract logic.
- Stellar blockchain providing consensus and immutable transaction records.
- Cryptographic standards for signature and document authenticity.

## Contribution
Open for healthcare technologists, blockchain developers, and privacy advocates to extend and secure this important healthcare infrastructure. Contributions via forks and pull requests welcome.
